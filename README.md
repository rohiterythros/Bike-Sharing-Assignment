# Project Name
> This is a study wherein a multiple linear regression model is built for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Table of Contents
* The study of demand of bikes in a bike sharing company based on various factors
* Python 3
* The demand increases during the months in Summer and Fall seasons
* I thank IIT-B, UpGrad for giving me this assignment. It was a great opportunity to learn through regression by doing this assignment. A special thanks to Vishwesh, my UpGrad buddy for all his help.
